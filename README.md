# Overview

I wrote a simple Tic-Tac-Toe program. I followed closely a youtube video and learned from it. The Youtube video is linked below. I was able to make some changes to the code and added a feature that he did not account for. He did not have a way of accounting for the situation where there is a tie. The program was just frozen and the "Play Again" button would not appear. I used what I learned from his Youtube video and fixed that.

I decided to go with this project because I thought it would be a fun thing to build. I have always enjoyed the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
